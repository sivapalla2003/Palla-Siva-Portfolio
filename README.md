# 🚀 Palla Siva – AI-Powered Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio – a fully AI-integrated web project created with the help of **Lovable.dev** and custom configurations. This project not only showcases my technical skills and projects but also serves as an experimental ground for AI prompt engineering, tuning, and real-time optimization.

👉 Here is my AI-generated portfolio: https://palla-siva.lovable.app

## 🧠 Key Learnings

This project was a huge learning experience. I explored:

- Prompt engineering – writing and refining prompts for better AI outputs  
- Prompt tuning – optimizing responses from LLMs using context management  
- Prompt chaining – feeding user data into dynamic sections  
- Customizing build pipelines with Vite, ESLint, and PostCSS  
- Best practices with .gitignore, tsconfig, and project structure

## 💡 How AI is Used

- Integrated prompts to auto-fill sections like About, Skills, and Projects  
- Exploring chatbot integration for visitor interaction  
- Using prompt-based generation to personalize content dynamically
